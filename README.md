# Michael Jackson scarer
This is an extremely stupid project I have majorly overengineered using some spare parts.  
There is a motion sensor. When it detects movement, it plays [this sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCkGAfNHygw).  
The time spent on making this will undoubtedly give a high ROI, long-term.  

The speaker has a little bit of noise after playing audio. I'm sure somebody with the will and effort can fix it up.
